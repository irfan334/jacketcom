        <h1>About this website (and the author, of course)</h1>
		<p>Hello, welcome to this website. I'd like to first warn that you will probably not find anything useful here, not unless if you love reading pointless texts on pointless websites. This website, or rather a bunch of HTML files hosted on GitHub, is my pet project with the objective to (attempt) create a personal website as well as further strengthen my HTML (HyperText Markup Language, something used to design websites, for you non-programmers) coding skills.
		<br /><br />Now, any search engine should be able to access this website, although buried in millions of other known parts of the internet. So, the chances of someone reading this to be just a random stranger from the internet is very unlikely. If you are reading this, you've probably discovered this place because I linked it in a certain social media page of mine.<br /><br />
		Speaking of social media, it's funny how we can feel secure sharing our personal information on things like facebook or instagram when it is, in fact, a part of the internet, where most people put anonymity as a number one priority. Where am I going with this? Well, since my information is already out there somewhere in the web, I figured it couldn't hurt too much to give a bit of my identity. My name is Irfan. I live in Malaysia. I'm a student. I also go by my internet alias, 'Jacketguy' (hence the (hopefully) temporary name of the website, Jacketcom). Anyway, what else is there to say? Oh, you may also find random projects of mine in this website popping up from time to time. Well then, enjoy.</p>
